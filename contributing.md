## Contributing guidelines


### Structure of a proposal
Here is how a proposal should be structured for easier reviewing and discussions

* **Proposal and rationale behind**, in the form of a *``proposal file``*. This file should explain what change it is proposing and provide a **justification for the change**.
* **An example** and its dedicated subfolder in the `examples/` folder


### Avoid big pull requests

We could do all our work in a branch of the main [bids-specification](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification) repository.
We would be able to see how our proposed changes affected the current version of the specification by opening a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

However, there are quite a few changes to make, and quite a lot of conversation to have around each of them, so our proposed way of working is to **break up the individual changes into manageable chunks**.


### Create the pull request

[BEP028](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/487) has a [dedicated branch](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/tree/bep-028) on the [bids-specification repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification).

**Contributing to the BEP028 requires creating a pull request to be merged to this branch**

There will then be some wrangling to make the one big pull request to the bids-specification.
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it! :sparkles:
